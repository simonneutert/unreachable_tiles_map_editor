# Unreachable Tiles Map Editor

This is a simple map editor to track unreachable tiles on a map (mercator
projection).\
It is built with Deno and Oak, and uses Handlebars for templating.\
You will need a Mapbox API key to run this project.

> [!NOTE]\
> No tests were written for this project.\
> The main goal was to learn how to use [Deno](https://deno.com) (and
> [Oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak)) and run on a VPS.\
> As the feature set is small, I decided to skip the tests for now.\
> Good enough software ships faster than perfect software. 🤙 #yoco

## Data format / JSON Schema

The json data for this project is a simple structure, with the bare minimum to
represent the unreachable tiles.

Supported tile zooms are 13, 14, 15, 16.

JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "name": String,
  "city": String,
  "country": String,
  "tiles_by_zoom": {
    "String zoom": [
      {
        "String x": Integer,
        "String y": Integer
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Truppenübungsgelände Baumholder",
  "city": "Baumholder",
  "country": "Germany",
  "tiles_by_zoom": {
    "13": [
      {
        "x": 4262,
        "y": 2790
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
